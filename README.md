# Personal Website Documentation:

**This is a WIP!**

This website is meant to be a demo of my web development skills, as well as a more thorough version of my resume. Employers may view this repository whenever they want, mainly to analyze my coding abilities. 

Tools that are used for this website:
* HTML5
* CSS
* JavaScript/jQuery
* Bootstrap

This will be used as a log to track updates.
